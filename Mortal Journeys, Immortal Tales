            <h2>Mortal Journeys, Immortal Tales</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2024-01-02">January 2, 2024</time></p>
            <p> Do not despair, for we walk the same path. The journey of Moses and Jesus, and the trails of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. 
                We travel alongside Spartacus and Crixus. We are joined by a common fate; the fate of Napoleon and George Washington. 
                We are all bound by mortality - as was Genghis. 
                Death is the inevitable end, yet it is an inauguration. 
                An inauguration into the annals of time. 
                We find our common story in this eternal cycle: a tapestry woven by the threads of history.
