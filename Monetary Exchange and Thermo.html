                Can monetary exchange be viewed as a record-keeping mechanism for energy conversion efficiency?

                Let's use a business as the basis for this thought experiment. </br>


                Given that a business's role is to take in inputs in the form of raw materials and/or human resources to ultimately provide finished products and/or services, it can be abstracted down to an energy conversion mechanism. The more efficient this energy conversion mechanism is, the more profitable it seems to be.

            <br>Taking this a step further to include entropic considerations: as a system’s entropy approaches infinity, the amount of energy that can be extracted from it for useful work approaches zero. Since I posit that an organization’s economic value is largely determined by its net positive energy conversion capacity, it follows that organizations should strive to consistently resist entropy.

                <br> Having said that, a certain degree of chaos can be beneficial during periods of significant changes or innovative leaps, which are necessary for business survival and market relevance. However, as long as this chaos is well-managed and energy inputs are properly directed, entropy can be kept at an acceptable level.

                In essence, an organization's value can be distilled to its ability to minimize entropy and maximize net positive energy conversion consistently over time.
