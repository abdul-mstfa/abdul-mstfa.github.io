            <h2>Information Rate</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2024-03-30">March 30, 2024</time></p>
            <p> Think of information as being supplied at different frequency levels. These frequency levels define how quickly new information arises or how quickly old information is updated.
                <br> <ol>
                    1. Low frequency: this is where things like mathematics, physics, computer science, and evolutionary theory exist - to name a few. This is the far left side of the spectrum. The update rate is so low here that it is a reliable substrate upon which to build. Imagine if the "laws of physics" were being updated every hour, can reliable engineering (i.e. applied science) exist? 
                    <br><br>2. High frequency: at the other end of the spectrum we get things like news and social media. With every refresh you are supplied with an endless barrage of content. 
                    
                </ol>
               
                <p>In the low frequency domain, the signal is fairly clean as the information goes through a rigorous noise filtering mechanism. The incentive is to produce robust, well researched, and heavily tested & filtered content. Whereas in the high frequency domain, the signal is often quite noisy. The incentive is speed and attention. 
                
                Information exists along a sliding scale of frequencies. Think of breaking news versus the long news cycles (eg. Israel/Palestine conflict, the Cold War, China's uprising and risks to the US). Not all news are super high frequency, but most tend to be. 
            </p>
                <p>If you think back to the last 4 years (this writing is in March, 2024), which news items have stuck and have had/will likely have measurable impact on today's society? I can name but a few:
                
                * The Covid-19 pandemic and all associated consequences
                * Russia/Ukraine Conflict
                * China's increased posturing as it pertains to Taiwan's sovereignty
                * AI's escape velocity out of research hubs and proliferation into personal and commercial use cases
            </p>
                These examples illustrate the difference between transient noise and enduring high-frequency events that transition into longer-term conversation. They remain at the forefront of global awareness because their impact is significant, ongoing, and measurable.
                
                Whether discussing low-frequency sciences or high-frequency media, understanding the pace at which knowledge evolves helps us evaluate its reliability and significance. A balanced information diet—recognizing when we’re dealing with tried-and-true fundamentals versus quickly shifting headlines—can help us become more discerning consumers, producers, and sharers of knowledge.</p>
